# frontend/

Next.js (App Router, TypeScript) + Tailwind CSS v4 application. Serves the interactive documentary-style site; reads all its data from `../backend`'s API, never queries the database directly.

## Design system

- **Dark-first, editorial palette** — the site defaults to dark mode (the "documentary" reading experience the project is going for), with a full light-mode toggle for accessibility/preference (`components/theme-toggle.tsx`, powered by `next-themes`).
- **Typography**: [Fraunces](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fraunces) (a warm, editorial serif) for headlines, [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) for body/UI text. Both self-hosted via `next/font/google` — no external font requests at runtime.
- **Color tokens** live in `app/globals.css` as CSS custom properties (Tailwind v4's CSS-first `@theme` config, not a `tailwind.config.js`). Each city has its own accent hue (`accent-chicago`, `accent-nyc`, `accent-sf`) used consistently across every chart and map in later milestones.
- Dark mode is class-based (`@custom-variant dark (&:where(.dark, .dark *))`), toggled by `next-themes` setting a `.dark` class on `<html>` — not just `prefers-color-scheme` — so the toggle button actually works regardless of OS setting.

## Running locally

Requires the backend running (see `../backend/README.md`) — the homepage does a live server-side fetch to `/api/summary`.

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.local.example .env.local   # adjust NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL if needed
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000`.

## A note on Next.js 16

This project uses Next.js 16, which shipped after this assistant's training cutoff with real breaking changes (Turbopack on by default, fully-async `params`/`searchParams`, opt-in Cache Components/PPR). Before writing App Router code here, check `node_modules/next/dist/docs/01-app/02-guides/upgrading/version-16.md` (bundled with the installed package) rather than assuming older Next.js conventions still apply.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # dev server (Turbopack)
npm run build    # production build + type check
npm run lint     # ESLint
```
